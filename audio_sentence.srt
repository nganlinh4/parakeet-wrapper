1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,760
I've got an idea for a Heinz ketchup commercial.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,680
I was at this super posh restaurant.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,350
Super posh.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,360
The type of place that has chandeliers and paintings on the

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,620
wall and way too many forks.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,920
I think classical music was playing.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,550
But maybe it was jazz.

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,220
No, definitely classical.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,690
The hostess walks up to me and she said, Mr.

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,770
Sheeran, is this your first time dining with us?

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,120
And I say, yep.

12
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,070
The waiter comes over, he's telling me about the specials.

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,970
Super fancy, fancy vegetables, fancy sauces.

14
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,980
I said, sounds fancy.

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,360
So fast forward and the food comes.

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,920
The waiter goes on to tell me, we are proud to present this

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,240
farm to table, blah blah blah, posh and fancy, blah blah

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,550
blah, with a side blah blah blah.

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,760
You know the food looked good.

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,520
I just thought there was something missing.

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,680
So I reach into my bag and I take out the only thing that

22
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,730
can complete me.

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,630
And at that point the whole world came to a stop.

24
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,710
And the waiter was screaming through his eyes.

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,070
So that's my idea.

26
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,930
Do you want to do it?
