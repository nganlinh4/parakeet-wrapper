00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,840
I've enjoyed so many meetings with Prime Minister. He's su

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,120
ch an incredible student. And every time I see him, he wants

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,480
to learn about technology, artificial intelligence, the

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,480
potential and opportunity for India, the impact on India

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,840
society and industry. And so I was delighted to be here to tal

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,360
k about it. India, as you know, is also home of some of the wor

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,240
ld's greatest computer scientists. So this is a great o

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,760
pportunity. Artificial intelligence is also a new indust

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,520
ry, a new manufacturing industry that's very important.

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,320
And so I'm looking forward to partnering with India in a very

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,440
deep way to make that possible. We have many partnerships

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,240
with India. For one, we're helping India gain access to our

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,880
most advanced technologies. We're partnering with

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,480
internet companies like Yoda and end-to-end networks and

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,880
to create the latest generation AI supercomputers in India

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,400
for all of the startups. India is the home of the third larg

17
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,320
est startup economy. And so this new generation of startups

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,640
are all based on AI. And in order to do so, you have to have AI

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,360
infrastructure. Just the number of partnerships we have

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,360
all over India. Every IIT has an NVIDIA AI center of excellen

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,960
ce. We're teaching professionals, we're teaching stud

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,760
ents how to upskill into this new world of AI. AI in a lot of wa

23
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,760
ys is very complicated technology, but in the end, what it en

24
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,880
ables a country to do is take advantage of technology, take

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,000
advantage of computers in a way that has never been possible

26
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,640
before. And so AI really democratized computing. This is

27
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,600
India's moment. You have to seize the opportunity.
