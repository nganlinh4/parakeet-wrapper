1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,000
I've enjoyed so many meetings with Prime Minister. He's such

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,360
an incredible student. And every time I see him, he wants to

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,800
learn about technology, artificial intelligence, the

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,720
potential and opportunity for India, the impact on India

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,840
society and industry. And so I was delighted to be here to

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,280
talk about it. India, as you know, is also home of some of

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,240
the world's greatest computer scientists. So this is a great

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,560
opportunity. Artificial intelligence is also a new industry,

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,160
a new manufacturing industry that's very important. And so

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,880
I'm looking forward to partnering with India in a very deep

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,840
way to make that possible. We have many partnerships with

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,640
India. For one, we're helping India gain access to our most

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,760
advanced technologies. We're partnering with internet

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,600
companies like Yoda and end-to-end networks and to create

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,840
the latest generation AI supercomputers in India for all of

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,280
the startups. India is the home of the third largest startup

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,960
economy. And so this new generation of startups are all

18
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,880
based on AI. And in order to do so, you have to have AI

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,920
infrastructure. Just the number of partnerships we have all

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:18,000
over India. Every IIT has an NVIDIA AI center of excellence.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,160
We're teaching professionals, we're teaching students how to

22
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,320
upskill into this new world of AI. AI in a lot of ways is

23
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,320
very complicated technology, but in the end, what it enables

24
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,040
a country to do is take advantage of technology, take

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,240
advantage of computers in a way that has never been possible

26
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,960
before. And so AI really democratized computing. This is

27
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,816
India's moment. You have to seize the opportunity.
