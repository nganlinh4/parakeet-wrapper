00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,160
I've got an idea for a Heinz ketchup commercial. I was at

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,360
this super posh restaurant. Super posh. The type of place

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,770
that has chandeliers and paintings on the wall and way too

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,800
many forks. I think classical music was playing. But maybe

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,550
it was jazz.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,160
No, definitely classical. The hostess walks up to me and she

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,770
said, Mr. Sheeran, is this your first time dining with us?

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,120
And I say, yep.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,070
The waiter comes over, he's telling me about the specials.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,500
Super fancy, fancy vegetables, fancy sauces. I said, sounds

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,000
fancy. So fast forward and the food comes. The waiter goes

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,800
on to tell me, we are proud to present this farm to table,

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,280
blah blah blah, posh and fancy, blah blah blah, with a side

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,000
blah blah blah. You know the food looked good. I just

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,850
thought there was something missing. So I reach into my bag

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,940
and I take out the only thing that can complete me. And at

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,630
that point the whole world came to a stop.

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,710
And the waiter was screaming through his eyes.

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,930
So that's my idea. Do you want to do it?
